**Veritone Automate Studio Flow Templates**

Each folder in this repo represents a flow template that needs to be developed for the flows library in Automate Studio. Those flows are meant to serve as "quickstart" templates that make it easy for users of Automate Studio to get started fast and easy.

**How to contribute?**

1. Pick a flow template you would like to build.
2. Add your name at the top of the readme file so others know you are working on this one.
3. Create and test the flow in Automate Studio.
4. Export the flow definition and add it to the relevant folder via Pull Request.
5. Make edits as needed to the flow readme and add supporting materials like screenshots, videos, and sample data.

Note: If you would like to propose a new flow template that is not on the list, create a new folder with a readme file in it that describes your idea.
